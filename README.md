# nodejs-file-manager

Please, take note of the following tips when you will be doing the review:

- If you won't provide username argument on "npm run start", username will be taken from OS.

- Please, use "\" before spaces in path and file names with them, e.g. "cd foldername/my\ favorite\ file.txt" (without quotes).

- In compress and decompress operations path_to_destination means path to folder, file name will be autogenerated.
